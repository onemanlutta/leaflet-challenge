# leaflet-challenge
This project uses Leaflet.js and D3.js to map earthquake data from USGS GeoJSON. Markers show quake locations, sized by magnitude and colored by depth. Optional tectonic plate boundaries enhance context. Users switch base maps and overlays. It educates on seismic events and showcases web mapping tech.
